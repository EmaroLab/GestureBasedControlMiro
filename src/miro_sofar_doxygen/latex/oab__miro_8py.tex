The node \mbox{\hyperlink{oab__miro_8py}{oab\+\_\+miro.\+py}} subscribes to the sonar and check the presence of an obstacle ~\newline
 If the obstacle is present the strategy is to start turning in the direction given by the user through the smartwatch until no obstacle is present anymore.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
The node \mbox{\hyperlink{oab__miro_8py}{oab\+\_\+miro.\+py}} subscribes to the sonar and check the presence of an obstacle ~\newline
 If the obstacle is present the strategy is to start turning in the direction given by the user through the smartwatch until no obstacle is present anymore.

 Subscribe to the topic /platform/sensors ~\newline
 Read the value from the sonar and check the presence of an obstacle ~\newline
 if there is an obstacle implement the obstacle avoidance behaviour ~\newline
 The obstacle avoidance behavior\+: ~\newline
 Subscribe to the topic /inertial ~\newline
 save the last acceleration value ~\newline
 if last acc\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}$>$ 0 save the right ~\newline
 if last acc\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}$<$0 save the left ~\newline
 Then Mi\+Ro starts turnin in the direction of the last value saved ~\newline
 few degree each time the same obstacle is detected until there is no obstacle anymore
